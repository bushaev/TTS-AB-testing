# TTS Model Comparison Tool

A web application for comparing and evaluating different Text-to-Speech (TTS) models through A/B testing. Users can listen to audio samples generated by different models and provide their preferences. In the end, the application provides statistics on the models' performance.

This website was build fully by AI - Claude 3.5 Sonnet with my guidance.  (Most of this README too)
