# A/B Testing for TTS Models

## Development

Initial prompt:
I initialize all the prompts with the description of the project:

```
I am building a web app that allows users to compare the quality of different TTS models.
I have a backend that has a list of audio files and a list of TTS models.
Also, I have a frontend that allows users to select a TTS model and play the audio file.
```
